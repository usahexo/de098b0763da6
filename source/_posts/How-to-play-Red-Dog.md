#  How to play Red Dog?

Red Dog is an easy and fast casino game to play. The aim of the game is to draw a card that is higher than the dealers card, without going over 21. Winning bets are paid at even money, while losing bets are collected by the house.

To play, players must first place an ante bet. After cards are dealt, players have the option to either fold (lose their ante) or raise (double their bet). If the player’s card is higher than the dealer’s, they win even money on both the ante and raise bets. If the player busts (goes over 21), they lose both the ante and raise bets. If the dealer busts, all players who did not fold win even money on their ante bets, and the raise bets are a push.

For example, if the face up card is a three of clubs, the player might bet that the next card will be a six of clubs or any other club.

There are variations of this game that can be found in different casinos across the world. Some of these variations include Double Deck Red Dog, which uses two decks of cards, and Progressive Red Dog, which has a progressive jackpot.

#  Is Red Dog a popular casino game?

Red Dog is a casino table game that is played using standard 52-card decks. The aim of the game is to predict whether the next card in the sequence will be higher or lower than the first two cards.

The game was created in the early 1800s and was originally known as "inverse". It became more popular during the California Gold Rush, when it was played in mining camps. The modern version of Red Dog was developed in 1979 by John Huxley.

There are a number of variations to the basic game, including:

- Double Down - In this variation, players may double their bet after seeing their first two cards. If they subsequently lose, they lose their entire original stake.

- Split - This variation allows players to split their hand if they are dealt two matching cards, creating two new hands that are then played independently.

- Progressive - In this variation, players can win a progressive jackpot by predicting correctly whether the next card will be higher or lower than the first two cards. The size of the jackpot increases with each hand that is played.
