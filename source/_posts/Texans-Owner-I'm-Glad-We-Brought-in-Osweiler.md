#  Texans Owner: I'm Glad We Brought in Osweiler

Houston Texans owner Bob McNair spoke to the media on Wednesday and had some positive things to say about the Texans' decision to bring in Brock Osweiler.

"We're glad to have him," McNair said. "He's a very good quarterback. He has a lot of ability, and we're looking forward to having him on our team."

Osweiler was acquired by the Texans in an offseason trade with the Denver Broncos. He is expected to compete for the starting quarterback job with Tom Savage.

McNair said he is confident that Osweiler can be productive in Houston's offense.

"He's been in a very good offensive system," McNair said. "Gary Kubiak knows how to use quarterbacks well, so I think Brock will do well here."
