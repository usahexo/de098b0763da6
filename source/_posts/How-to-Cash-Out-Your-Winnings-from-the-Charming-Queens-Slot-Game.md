* Bank Transfer: Bank transfers are a popular deposit method because they're cheap and relatively fast. However, not all casinos accept this payment method.

* Prepaid Cards: Prepaid cards are another popular deposit option because they're widely accepted and can be used for both deposits and withdrawals.
