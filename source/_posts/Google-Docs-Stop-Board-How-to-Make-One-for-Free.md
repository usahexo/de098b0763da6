There are a few different ways to create a stop board on Google Docs. In this tutorial, we'll show you two methods: how to create a stop board with text and images, and how to create a stop board with buttons.

## Method 1: With Text and Images

To create a stop board with text and images, follow these steps:

1. Open Google Docs and click "New."

2. Select "Document."

3. In the blank document, type the following headings: "Stop," "Location," "Time," "Description."

4. Below the headings, type your stops for the day. For example:

-Stop 1: School 
-Stop 2: Grocery store 
-Stop 3: Post office 
-Stop 4: Friends' house 
5. To add an image to a row, click the image icon in the toolbar above the document. Then, select an image from your computer. Repeat this step for each row of your stop board. You can resize or reposition the images by clicking and dragging them on the document. When you're finished, your stop board should look something like this:








6. To share your stop board with others, click File > Share > Publish to web. Copy the link and send it to your friends or classmates! They can open it in a web browser to see your stop board on Google Docs.


## Method 2: With Buttons

Another way to create a stop board is by using buttons instead of text and images. Here's how to do it:

2. Select "Spreadsheet."
3. In the blank spreadsheet, type the following headings: "Stop," "Location," "Time," "Description."

-Stop 1: School    -Location 1   -Time 1  -Description 1   -Stop 2: Grocery store 三 Location 2 三 Time 2 (Note that there are three locations in this row because we want to show how it would look if there were multiple locations.) -Description 2 (Note that we repeated Description 1 because we want it to show on two lines.) 5。 Repeat step 4 for each row of your stop board。 When you're finished, your spreadsheet should look something like this: Stop Location Time Description 1 School Location 1 Time 1 Description 1 2 Grocery store 地 3 Post office 地 4 Friends' house 地 5 Stop Location Time Description 6 School Location 2 Time 2 Description 2 7 Grocery store 地 8 Post office 地 9 Friends' house 地 10 Stop Location Time Description 11 School Location 3 Time 3 Description 3 12 Grocery store 地 13 Post office 地 14 Friends' house 地 15 When you have all of your data entered into the spreadsheet, follow these steps to create buttons that will show your stop board on Google Docs:1。 Click Insert > Form > Fields .。2。 Type "stop" into the first field name box。3。 Type "location" into the second field name box。4。 Type "time" into the third field name box。5。 Type "description" into the fourth field name box

#  How to Use a Stop Board in Google Docs

A stop board is a great way to keep track of your progress while writing a document. It can help you to avoid straying from the main topic, and to keep your thoughts organized.

To create a stop board in Google Docs, start by creating a table with two columns. In the first column, list the main points or topics that you want to cover in your document. In the second column, write a brief summary of each point.

As you write your document, keep track of which points you have covered by checking off the corresponding items in the first column. This will help you to ensure that you don’t forget anything, and that your document is well-organized.

You can also use a stop board to plan out a longer project, such as a research paper or a presentation. In this case, you would create a table with more than two columns, and use it to track all of the different stages of the project.
