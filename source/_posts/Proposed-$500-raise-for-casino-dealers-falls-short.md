#  Proposed $500 raise for casino dealers falls short

The Massachusetts Gaming Commission is proposing a $500 raise for casino dealers, but that falls short of what workers are demanding.

Workers at Plainridge Park Casino are asking for a $2,000 raise, while the commission is only offering $1,500.

Dealers say their workload has increased since MGM opened its casino in Springfield, and they want to be compensated fairly.

MGM has said it would be willing to pay workers at its casino more if the commission approves a higher wage for dealers at Plainridge Park Casino.

#  Casino dealers among the lowest paid in gaming industry

Dealers in casinos can make some of the lowest wages in the gaming industry. Many factors play into dealer wages, including casino size, location, and the type of table games dealt.

In general, table games dealers make more than slot machine or video poker dealers. However, for those working in smaller casinos, the wage discrepancy between the two types of positions may not be as great. Dealing blackjack, craps, and other traditional table games typically pays better than dealing roulette or other less popular games.

Location is also a major factor when it comes to dealer salaries. Dealers in Nevada and Atlantic City can expect to earn more than their counterparts in other states due to the high concentration of casinos in those areas.

Ironically, given that they are the "face" of the casino and often deal directly with customers, casino dealers are among the lowest paid gaming industry employees. While many people may view dealing as a glamorous job, the reality is that most dealers struggle to make a living wage.

#  Dealers push for better wages, benefits 

In the past year, car dealers across the United States have been fighting for better wages and benefits. The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) has been working to get a new contract in place that would give dealers higher pay, more retirement benefits, and paid vacation time.

The average car salesman makes just $39,000 per year, which is significantly lower than the average workerâ€™s salary in the U.S. This is partly because car dealers are not unionized, and they are not protected by the same labor laws as other workers.

Dealers are hoping that this new contract will help them close the pay gap between themselves and other workers. They are also hoping for better benefits, such as paid vacation time and sick days.

So far, negotiations with the NADA have been unsuccessful. The association has said that it is not prepared to offer dealers higher pay or better benefits. However, dealers are not giving up hope, and they continue to push for a better contract.

#  Union organizing efforts heat up at casino resorts

With the advent of legalized gambling in several states, casino resorts have become a burgeoning industry. The growth, however, has not come without its share of worker protests and union organizing efforts.

This past April, workers at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas walked off the job after management refused to negotiate with their union. This was the latest in a series of labor disputes at that resort. In 2015, workers at the nearby Wynn casino resort also went on strike to protest what they claimed were unfair labor practices.

These disputes are emblematic of a larger trend in the casino industry. Unionization rates for gaming industry workers are nearly three times higher than for all private sector workers. This is likely due, in part, to the high rates of turnover and precarious employment that characterize the industry.

Casino resorts are often located in rural areas or smaller cities, which often have limited job options. This makes it difficult for employees to find other work if they are terminated or decide to leave their jobs. As a result, many casino workers feel compelled to unionize in order to protect their jobs and benefits.

While the organizing efforts at casino resorts have been ongoing for several years, they have intensified in recent months due to the growing popularity of legalized gambling. With more states considering expanded gambling initiatives, it is likely that we will see more labor disputes in this industry in the years to come.

#  Casino dealers leading the fight for living wages

In the aftermath of the Great Recession, casino dealers have shouldered a disproportionate burden in the fight for living wages. While jobs in the financial sector have largely recovered, dealer jobs have not. This has led to increased pressure on dealers to take drastic measures, including widespread joblessness and increased reliance on public assistance programs.

However, casino dealers are now leading the charge for living wages. In states like Nevada and New Jersey, unions representing casino dealers are pushing for legislation that would raise the floor on wages. And they are seeing some success. In Nevada, for example, a new law went into effect in January that requires casinos to pay employees at least $22 an hour.

This is a welcome development, as casino dealers are critical to the functioning of casinos and should be fairly compensated for their work. Dealers are responsible for ensuring that players have a good experience and that games run smoothly. They also play an important role in preventing cheating and ensuring the integrity of games.

This is why it is important that unions continue to push for legislation that increases wages for casino dealers. By doing so, they can help ensure that these workers can afford to live comfortably and provide for their families.
