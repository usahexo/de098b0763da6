#  Tips for Starting Out in the Slot Machine Business on a Gas Station

A gas station is a great place to start a slot machine business. It has the advantage of being open 24 hours a day and seven days a week, so you can make money even when you're not there. There are some things to keep in mind, however, if you're thinking of starting this type of business.

You'll also need to make sure that you have the proper licenses and permits before starting your business. This includes a license from the state gaming commission as well as any other licenses or permits that may be required.
