Brazil has always been a powerhouse in international soccer, and they are hoping that their new superstar Neymar can lead them to victory.

#  Optimism Grows Amongst UK Soccer Fans After England's Strong World Cup Qualification Campaign

The English football fans who were filled with despair and negativity just a few months ago are now optimistic ahead of the World Cup. This radical change in attitude has come about after England's successful World Cup qualification campaign, which saw the team win nine out of ten games and finish as the top team in their group.

Many experts are predicting that this positive mood amongst the fans will lead to better performances from the England players in Russia. Indeed, many of the players have been speaking about how the feel-good atmosphere around the team is helping them to perform at their best.

Harry Kane, who scored six goals in qualification and was recently named captain of the team, said: "It’s a great time to be an England player. The manager, the staff and players all get on well. We have a good bond and we are all confident going into this tournament."

For goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, the feeling is mutual: "The togetherness we have is unbelievable. We want each other to do well – off the pitch and on it."

Of course, there is still some caution amongst UK soccer fans, as England have yet to win a knockout game at a major tournament since 1966. However, most fans now believe that Gareth Southgate's young squad has what it takes to make it all the way to the final this year.

#  Holland And Chile Clash In A Battle Of Optimism Ahead Of World Cup

The scene is set. On one side of the field, there is a squad of young, exciting players all eager to make their mark on football's biggest stage. Representing Holland, they are led by manager Ronald Koeman, who has instilled a buoyant mood and a winning mentality in the camp.

On the other side of the field is a team which has defied all expectations to qualify for the World Cup. Chile are coached by Juan Antonio Pizzi, who has managed to get the best out of his players and create an organised and unified unit.

Both teams come into this match with a lot of optimism. Holland were unbeaten in all 10 of their qualifiers and have looked good in warm-up matches against Portugal and England. Chile also had an excellent qualifying campaign, losing just twice en route to Russia.

Koeman will be looking to his stars, such as Memphis Depay, Ryan Babel and Virgil van Dijk, to make an impact on the game. However, he will also need others to step up if they are to progress deep into the tournament. In attack, Holland could be vulnerable if Arjen Robben or Robin van Persie get injured.

Pizzi has selected an experienced squad for Chile, with nine players having over 30 caps. Arturo Vidal will captain the side and is likely to play a key role in midfield alongside Charles Aranguiz and Alexis Sanchez. In defence, goalkeeper Claudio Bravo will need to be at his best if Chile are to keep out the attacking threat of Holland.

This is likely to be an open and exciting match with both sides looking to score goals. It should be a fascinating contest between two very evenly matched sides.

As long as these factors remain in place, Costa Rica is likely to continue surpassing its neighbors in terms of prosperity and stability.
