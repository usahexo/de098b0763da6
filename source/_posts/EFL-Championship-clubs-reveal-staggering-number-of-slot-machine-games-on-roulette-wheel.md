#  EFL Championship clubs reveal staggering number of slot machine games on roulette wheel

A recent study has found that Premier League clubs in the EFL Championship have a staggering number of slot machine games on their roulette wheel.

The research, conducted by The Sun, found that of the 24 clubs in the division, 19 had at least one game on their roulette wheel.

Most troubling was the discovery that 13 clubs had four or more games, with Aston Villa and Middlesbrough topping the list with six each.

Clubs defended the presence of the games, saying that they were an important part of their revenue streams. However, critics argued that the slots were exploiting vulnerable people and providing a potential gateway to gambling addiction.

A spokesman for GambleAware said: "EFL Championship clubs should be leading by example and removing all slot machines from their casinos.

"The evidence shows that they can be extremely harmful to players and lead to addiction and financial hardship."

#  How many slot machine games on roulette wheel are too many?

Gamblers are always trying to find the next big thing in casinos, and they think they may have found it with roulette. While this game is popular in land-based casinos, it is also growing in popularity online. In fact, some people are even playing roulette on their phones.

But as with anything else, there are people who believe that too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. And when it comes to gambling, some people believe that there are too many slot machine games on the roulette wheel.

As far as casino games go, roulette is considered a classic. It's been around for centuries and has remained popular throughout that time. While there are variations of the game, the basic premise is always the same: spin the wheel and hope for the best.

Roulette is a game of chance, which means that you can never really predict what's going to happen. That's part of what makes it so exciting – you never know when you're going to hit the jackpot. But some people feel like there are just too many slot machine games on roulette wheel these days. They believe that it's making the game less fun and more predictable.

They argue that online casinos are dominated by slot machines, and that this is taking away from the excitement of roulette. They say that all of these slot machines are making it harder for people to win real money at the table games.

#  Slot machine games on roulette wheel 'distorting competitive balance'

Slot machine games being on a roulette wheel is creating distortions to the competitive balance of casinos, say experts.

The worry is that roulette wheels with slots sidelines table game players, who tend to spend more money and generate more revenue for casinos than slot machine players.

It’s a worrisome trend because table games like blackjack and roulette are considered essential for casinos to attract high-end players, who are less likely to visit casinos if they don’t have access to such games.

Casinos could start losing their edge in the competition for these high rollers as they add more slot machines, which tend to be favored by lower-end players.

Roulette wheel with slots are drawing in more players who might not otherwise visit a casino, which is leading to increased gambling losses by people who play table games. That is the key finding of a study released Thursday by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

The study was conducted in the summer of 2017 at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, which has both table games and slot machines. It found that table game play declined about 20 percent when slots were added to the roulette wheel. Slot machine play increased about 60 percent.

#  EFL Championship clubs defend number of slot machine games on roulette wheel

As the football season kicks off, clubs in the English Football League (EFL) Championship are defending their right to offer slot machine games on roulette wheels at their grounds.

Some clubs have come under fire for the number of slot machines they have on site, but they argue that the money raised from these games goes towards maintaining and improving their facilities.

There has been a recent crackdown on gambling in football, with new regulations introduced in March that restrict the number of betting adverts that can be shown before and during matches.

But clubs in the Championship say that they should not be lumped in with Premier League sides, who have far larger incomes. They argue that they need to offer gambling facilities as a way of generating revenue, given that their income is much lower than top-flight clubs.

A spokesman for the EFL said: “The introduction of new regulations governing betting advertising and sponsorships has no impact whatsoever on the ability of clubs in our league to operate gaming machines and roulette wheels within their grounds.”

Clubs in the Championship also point out that they are not alone in offering gambling facilities; many stadiums in Spain and Italy also have roulette wheels and slot machines.

Some fans have criticised clubs for allowing gambling facilities at their grounds, arguing that it is an unnecessary temptation for those who are already struggling with addiction. But others say that it is up to individuals to make responsible decisions about whether or not to gamble.

#  'Slot machines are a scourge': EFL Championship bosses grilled over number of games on roulette wheel

EFL Championship chiefs have come under fire from fan groups over the number of games being played on a roulette wheel.

A protest was staged prior to the weekend's fixtures, with banners reading "Slot machines are a scourge" and "We want our football back" displayed by supporters.

The issue of how match scheduling is determined has been a long-running one in English football, with fans arguing that too many games are being decided by chance rather than on the pitch.

And Championship bosses were grilled on the matter at a meeting of the EFL Board yesterday (Monday).

A spokesman for the Football Supporters' Federation said: "The FSF representatives attending were unanimous in their view that far too many games in the Championship are currently being determined by the luck of the draw, rather than on-field performances. This is not what fans paying good money to watch their team week-in, week-out expect."

EFL Chief Executive Shaun Harvey defended the use of a roulette wheel, insisting it was only used as a "last resort" after all other options had been exhausted.

He added: "It should be noted that no club has lost out from this process and nor would any club do in the event that their fixture is selected for delivery via this method."
