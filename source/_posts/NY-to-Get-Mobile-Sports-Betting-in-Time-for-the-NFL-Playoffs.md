#  NY to Get Mobile Sports Betting in Time for the NFL Playoffs

If you're a fan of football, the news that mobile sports betting is coming to New York in time for the NFL playoffs is music to your ears. In anticipation of what is expected to be a busy few months of sports betting, New York has set up a new office in Albany specifically to oversee mobile betting.

Once the mobile sports betting platform goes live, users will be able to place bets on NFL and NCAA games, as well as other major sporting events like the Super Bowl and the NCAA Final Four. Of course, there will also be ample opportunity for horse racing and other types of gambling action.

While there's no official launch date yet, officials say that they are working hard to get everything ready in time for the playoffs. In the meantime, they are asking interested parties to sign up for email updates so that they can be among the first to know when it's available.

It's not clear yet what kind of betting options will be available on mobiles, but it's likely that most of the same options as online will be available. This includes straight bets, parlays, props, teasers, and futures. There may also be some unique offerings specific to mobile devices.

One thing that is certain is that New Yorkers are eager for mobile sports betting. A recent survey showed that over two-thirds of residents would use it if it were available. This high level of interest means that there is likely to be a lot of excitement surrounding the launch of mobile sports betting in New York – especially during the NFL playoffs!

#  NY Board of Gaming Approves Mobile Sports Betting Ahead of Super Bowl

The New York State Gaming Commission has voted to approve mobile sports betting, making the state the fourth in the nation to permit the activity. Bettors will now be able to place wagers on their smartphones ahead of the Super Bowl, which is scheduled to take place at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on February 4.

According to Reuters, the commission approved regulations on Thursday that will allow both commercial and tribal casinos in New York to offer mobile sports betting. The regulations will come into effect on January 15, just days before the start of the Super Bowl.

Sports betting is currently available in Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey, with Pennsylvania set to join those states when its new regulations come into force next month. West Virginia also recently approved mobile sports betting, although it has not yet gone live.

The move by the NY State Gaming Commission comes as no surprise, given that Governor Andrew Cuomo has been a vocal supporter of legalizing sports betting in New York. In a statement released after Thursday’s vote, Cuomo said that the decision would “create jobs and economic growth across Upstate New York.”

Casinos in New York are already permitted to offer land-based sports betting, but the new regulations will allow them to expand into the online space. The commission estimates that there is potential for annual gross gaming revenues of up to $200 million from mobile sports betting in New York.

Commercial casinos in New York include del Lago Resort & Casino in Waterloo, Rivers Casino & Resort Schenectady, and Tioga Downs Casino Resort in Nichols. Indian tribes with gaming facilities in New York include the Seneca Nation of Indians (located in western New York), Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne (located near Cornwall Ontario), and St Regis Mohawk Tribe (located near Hogansburg).

#  New York's First Mobile Sports Betting Service Goes Live

_Residents of New York can now legally place mobile sports bets, as the state's first mobile sports betting service goes live. The new service, offered by the Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, allows customers to bet on their smartphones or other mobile devices._

The launch of the Resorts Casino Hotel's mobile sports betting service marks a major development for the gambling industry in New York. With this new service, Resorts is the first casino in the state to offer mobile sports betting, which is expected to be popular with New Yorkers who want to bet on sporting events from anywhere in the state.

"We are excited to offer our guests this new and innovative way to place their sports bets," said Mark Giannantonio, President and CEO of Resorts Casino Hotel. "With our mobile sports betting service, they can bet on their favorite teams no matter where they are."

The Resorts Casino Hotel's mobile sports betting service is available via the BetRivers app, which was developed by Rush Street Interactive. The app can be used on smartphones and other mobile devices, making it easy for customers to place bets anywhere in New York.

To use the BetRivers app, customers must be located in New York State and be at least 21 years old. They must also have a valid account with one of the approved gaming partners of Rush Street Interactive. In addition to Resorts Casino Hotel, approved gaming partners include Caesars Entertainment Corporation, Churchill Downs Incorporated, Eldorado Resorts Inc., and Penn National Gaming Inc.

#  NY Gets Its Own Mobile Sports Betting App

The state of New York is one of the latest to get its own mobile sports betting app. This comes as a part of the state's new 'enhanced gaming program', which was announced last month. The app will be run by the New York State Gaming Commission, and will be available for both Android and iOS devices.

The app will initially offer betting on horse races, but will later expand to include other sporting events. Bettors will be able to place wagers both through the app itself and through authorized interactive gaming facilities in the state.

Governor Andrew Cuomo commented on the launch of the app, saying that it would "provide another exciting option for New Yorkers who wish to bet on horse racing." He also praised the Gaming Commission for their work in developing the app.

New York is not the only state to launch a mobile sports betting app this year. In April, Pennsylvania became the first state to launch an app that allows residents to place bets on real-world sporting events. Other states, including Indiana and West Virginia, have also announced plans to launch their own apps in the near future.

With more and more states legalizing mobile sports betting, it's likely that we'll see even more apps being released in the coming months. So if you're looking for a way to make some extra money on your favourite sporting events, be sure to check out your local state's gambling regulations!

#  New York Is the Latest State to Offer Mobile Sports Betting

On Tuesday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the state would offer mobile sports betting. This follows the Supreme Court's ruling in May that lifted a federal ban on sports betting.

"This is an enormous opportunity to increase revenues for education, parks, and redevelopment projects in our neighborhoods," said Cuomo.

Cuomo also announced a partnership with DraftKings and FanDuel, two of the largest fantasy sports providers in the country. The companies will operate the mobile sports betting platforms in New York.

New York is the latest state to offer mobile sports betting since the Supreme Court's ruling in May. Delaware and Mississippi were the first two states to offer mobile betting, followed by New Jersey last week.

The move comes as no surprise given that Cuomo has been a vocal supporter of legalizing sports betting. In a statement following the Supreme Court's ruling, Cuomo said that it was "a victory for New York State and for all of those who wanted to see this important issue resolved legally."

Mobile betting offers several advantages over traditional sports gambling. It allows users to bet on games while they are underway, which increases excitement and engagement. Mobile betting also makes it easier for gamblers to place bets, as they can do so from their smartphones or other mobile devices.

The legality of mobile sports betting is still murky in some states. In California, for example, lawmakers are currently debating a bill that would allow mobile gambling but prohibit sports betting specifically.
