#  Research Shows That Sports Betting Odds Favor Baskonia To Win

The regular season of the Liga ACB has come to an end and it is now time for the playoffs. The first round will start on April 23 and it will see two Spanish teams, Baskonia and Real Madrid, face each other.

According to the sports betting odds, Baskonia is a clear favorite to win this matchup. The team from Vitoria-Gasteiz is currently at +160, while Real Madrid is at -200. This means that a $100 bet on Baskonia would return $160 if they win, while a $100 bet on Real Madrid would only return $20 if they win.

This isn't too surprising, given that Baskonia finished in second place in the Liga ACB standings, while Real Madrid came in fourth. Additionally, Baskonia has been one of the best teams in Europe over the past few years, while Real Madrid has struggled a bit recently.

Still, anything can happen in a playoff series and Real Madrid is definitely capable of pulling off an upset. They will have home court advantage in this series and they also have some very talented players, including Luka Doncic and Sergio Llull.

There are certainly some people who are betting on Real Madrid to pull off the upset here. If you think that they can do it, then you can find odds of +425 available at some sports betting sites. This means that a $100 bet on Real Madrid would return $425 if they win.

#  Baskonia Expected To Win By More Than 1 Unit

The Spanish League is back and Baskonia is expected to win by more than 1 unit against Herbalife Gran Canaria.

Baskonia was one of the best teams in Europe last season, reaching the semi-finals of the Euroleague. They have kept most of their players from last year and have only added one new player, Maik Zirbes. Gran Canaria was a middle-of-the-road team in the Liga ACB last season and they have not made any major signings this summer.

Baskonia are at home for this game and they are expected to win by more than 1 unit. Their odds at most sportsbooks are around -175, which means that a $100 bet on them would return $57.14 in profits. I would recommend betting on Baskonia in this game.

#  Could A Small Bet On Baskonia Pay Off Big?

For the 2017-2018 season, Baskonia Vitoria Gasteiz (or "Baskonia" as they are more commonly known) is a Euroleague basketball club that is currently ranked 4th in the league. They hail from the autonomous Basque Country region in northern Spain and have a passionate fan base. Last year, they made it to the semi-finals but were ultimately defeated by Olympiacos Piraeus. 

This year, things are looking up for Baskonia. With new head coach Pablo Prigioni at the helm, they have started off strong and look poised to make a run for the championship. So far this season, they have beaten teams like Panathinaikos Athens, Khimki Moscow Region, and Maccabi Tel Aviv. In addition to their strong play on the court, they also have an impressive roster of players, including Kevin Love of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Pau Gasol of the San Antonio Spurs. 

Given all of this, now might be a good time to consider betting on Baskonia. If you think they're going to make a deep run in the playoffs, now is your chance to make some money off of it! Of course, nothing is guaranteed in sports betting, but if you do your research and make a smart bet, you could stand to make some serious profits. 

So far this season, Baskonia's odds of winning the Euroleague championship are 20/1. If you think they have what it takes to pull off an upset and win it all, now is your chance to put some money down on them! Keep in mind that these odds could change as the playoffs draw closer, so be sure to check them frequently and place your bets accordingly. 

No matter who you're rooting for in this year's Euroleague playoffs, there's always something fun (and profitable!) to be had when betting on basketball games. Thanks for reading and good luck with your bets!

#  Sports Bettors Believe Baskonia Will Win By More Than 1 Unit

The sports betting market is indicating that Baskonia will beat Darussafaka by more than 1 unit tonight. Baskonia is a -1.5 favorite at most sportsbooks, with the implied win probability at around 68%.

However, Darussafaka has been playing much better as of late, losing only one game in their past six outings. They are also coming off a road win against Maccabi Tel Aviv, so they will not be an easy opponent for Baskonia.

Nevertheless, Baskonia should still be able to win by more than 1 unit. They have been one of the best teams in Europe this season, while Darussafaka is still a young and inexperienced squad. All things considered, the sports betting market seems to have it right here and Baskonia should be expected to win comfortably.

#  Sports Bettors May Be Underestimating How Much Baskonia Will Win By

A number of sports bettors may be underestimating how much Baskonia is going to win by when the two teams meet in their upcoming match. Coming into the matchup, the odds are giving the home team only a 2 point advantage. However, there are many factors that suggest Baskonia will win by more than that.

For one, Baskonia has been playing very well lately. They come into this matchup on a five-game winning streak and they have looked dominant in most of those games. They have also been successful against top competition, including a victory over Real Madrid not too long ago. In contrast, Unicaja has been struggling recently. They have lost four of their last six games and they have not looked particularly impressive during that stretch.

 Additionally, Unicaja is dealing with some key injuries heading into this game. Their best player, Nico Laprovittola, is out with an ankle injury and that will be a big loss for them. Laprovittola is averaging over 14 points per game this season and he does a lot of damage from beyond the arc. With him out, Unicaja will be significantly weakened offensively.

Meanwhile, Baskonia is relatively healthy heading into this matchup. They only have one player who is listed as questionable for the game and he is not a major contributor. Overall, Baskonia looks like the much stronger team heading into this matchup and they should be able to win by more than 2 points.
