In general, women can wear skirts or pants and nice blouses, while men can wear slacks and button-down shirts. However, there are no hard-and-fast rules, so feel free to be creative. Just make sure that whatever you wear is comfortable and does not interfere with your ability to have a good time.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure what to wear, take a look at what other people are wearing. You don’t want to be the only one in formal attire when everyone else is dressed in jeans and t-shirts.

<p>In general, it’s best to avoid clothing that is too flashy or revealing. You don’t want to stand out for the wrong reasons! And keep in mind that you will probably be walking a lot, so choose shoes that are comfortable and won’t give you blisters.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about what to wear to casino night, feel free to ask someone at the party. They will be able to give you some helpful advice based on what they are wearing. And most importantly, have fun!</p>
